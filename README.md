# Tsuyu-WebUI
Welcome to Tsuyu-WebUI! This is the repository for Tsuyu's frontend, maintained by [parabirb](https://birb.works). Please contact me@birb.works (@parabirb on Discord, @birb.1312 on Signal) for more information.

Please note that since Tsuyu-WebUI assumes features that are **not** available on Ame, such as streaming, it is **not** compatible with Ame.
